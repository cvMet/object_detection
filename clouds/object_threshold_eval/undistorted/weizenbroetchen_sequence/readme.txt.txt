Aim:
Calculate the # Matches for an object to be considered detected

Method:
Vary the detection threshold (how many keypoints must be detected for an object to be considered detected)
Draw a PR Graph on how many objects were detected correctly.

Notes:
Buerli, roggenbroetli aus threshold_eval dataset. For Gipfeli only cloud data is added.
All clouds are contained in folder sequence (see continuous numbering scheme)

CloudStructure:
